This is a simple explanation on how to train a model in batches.


1. Create N batches using generate_splits.py (or generate_splits_train_val.py in case we want to train on
    both train and val set).

2. Use catboost_batch_training.py to train catboost in batches.


3. Use sum_models.ipynb to create merge the obtained models into a single one.

Inside each file there are variables that point to files or contain configuration, please change that 
variables to run your soultion.
