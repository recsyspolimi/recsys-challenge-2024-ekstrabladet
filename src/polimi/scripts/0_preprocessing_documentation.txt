HOW TO USE PREPROCESSING

For preprocessing the dataset you could use:
    - batch_preprocessing.py
    - preprocessing.py

parameters to pass are
    -output_dir                 "The directory where the models will be placed"
                                default="../../experiments/"
                
    -dataset_path               "Directory where the dataset is placed"

    -dataset_type               "Specify the type of dataset: ['train', 'validation', 'test']"
                                
    -preprocessing_version      "Specifiy the preprocessing version to use. Default is 'latest' valuses are 
                                ['68f', '94f', '115f','127f','latest']"

    -previous_version           "Specify the path of a previous version of the dataset to use as a reference 
                                for the new one. Default is None.
                                YOU MUST GUARANTEE THE COMPATIBILITY BETWEEN VERSIONS."
                            
previous_version parameter is ignored when we use preprocessing.py script since it's expected behaviour is to compute
the preprocessing from scratches. Up to now only 127f version implements previous_version behaviour and it requires a 
dataset with the 94f version
